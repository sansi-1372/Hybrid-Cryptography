# Hybrid-Cryptography
Hybrid Cryptography is a mode of cryptography that merges two or more cryptography
systems. Hybrid Encryption is a concept in cryptography which combines or merge
one or two cryptography algorithms to generate more effective encrypted text. It
incorporates a combination of asymmetric and symmetric cryptography to benefit
from the strengths of each form of cryptography. These strengths are respectively
defined as speed and security.
